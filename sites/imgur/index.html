							I&apos;ve always loved creating things, from the city scale to furniture and now to the digital interface.  Designing across mediums has challenged me at every step of the way, enabling me to bring fresh perspectives to the table. I believe that life is too short to not love and believe in what you do. I believe in the value of imgur and that the opportunity to contribute my personality paired with my technical and critical thinking skills would be mutually beneficial.

							My name is Jasper and I’m an imgurian.  I want to be a part of the magic as a UI designer for the imgur team.

							I believe that my skills and experience with the web and design at large can have a positive impact on imgur and the team.   I have designed at different scales and through multiple mediums, including architecture, industrial design, and furniture.  

							As a fellow imgurian, I personally experience the joy you bring to the world on a daily basis and I would be humbled at the opportunity to be a part of it.

							The imgur UI has been quite pleasant to use and intuitive as a whole, but I have encountered a few issues.  Fortunately, I have a few thoughts on how these issues can be addressed:
