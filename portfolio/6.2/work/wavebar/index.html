					<strong>Market Studies</strong></br>
					Existing home bar sets from comparable companies were studied to assess expected features, materials, price points, etc., and to discover potential market opportunities.  This was aimed at the $500 level, priced below most comparable existing bars without sacfricing style.

					<strong>Inspiration</strong></br>
					The simple but sturdy construction of bookcases provided structural guidance.  Spare pieces from another project provided unexpected inspiration for the form of the facade.

					<strong>Concept</strong></br>
					TThe Wave Bar incorporates findings from market studies and provides a cost-effective and sturdy structure, while providing an aesthetically-pleasing lattice form that continues from solid to void.

					<strong>Development</strong></br>
					Several combinations of material and lattice form were considered, weighing aethetics and perceived value with material costs. The uniform lattice was ultimately chosen, largely due to its cost savings from using only one mould to create all the lattice pieces.

					<strong>Flat Pack Design</strong></br>
					The Wave Bar and all the parts that make up the assembly were designed for maximum efficiency in transportation and storage through flat pack design.

				<div class='contentCaption'>
					<strong>Lattice Prototyping</strong></br>
					The lattice pattern was prototyped by constructing a mould with the lattice's profile and vacuum-forming five layers of glued plywood sheets to the mould. The same profile was CNC routed out of the front panel to continue the pattern in void.

					<strong>Finishing</strong></br>
					Once all the necessary pieces were cut, bend, and/or sanded, the surfaces were treated with a cherry stain.
