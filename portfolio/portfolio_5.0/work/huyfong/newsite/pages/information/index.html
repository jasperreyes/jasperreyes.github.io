<!-- 						<p class='taglineText'></p>

						<p>
							Huy Fong Foods, with its humble beginnings in Los Angeles, California in 1980, has grown to become one of the leaders in the Asian hot sauce market. When Huy Fong Foods started business, it was producing, by hand, their first chili sauce: Pepper Saté Sauce. This particular sauce was developed by the company's founder. He was producing and selling this sauce in his native country of Vietnam before he arrived in the United States. Eventually, he formulated four more chili products: Chili Garlic Sauce, Sambal Oelek (Ground Fresh Chili Paste), Sambal Badjak (Chili Paste with Onions), and finally, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, which is currently Huy Fong Food's most well known and best selling items.
						</br></br>
							In 1986, Huy Fong Foods moved into a 68,000 square foot building in Rosemead, California. Here, the company has continued to increase production every year, but still never being able to keep up with demand.
						</br></br>
							Huy Fong Foods' chili sauces are made from fresh, red Jalapeño chili peppers and contain no water or artificial colors. This results in sauces that are flavorful and hot. All of the five sauces are manufactured in Rosemead, California. Huy Fong Foods has begun to break away from being known as a sauce for only Asian food and now is being known as a hot sauce for all cultures. Some uses for the sauce include topping pizzas, marinating meat, adding heat to chilies and soups, and spicing up salsas.
						</br></br>
							Characterized by the clear plastic bottles, green caps, and Rooster logo, the sauces can be found almost anywhere.
						</br></br>
							The secret of the sauces . . . ? Continued high quality ingredients at low prices and great taste makes it a success in today's trend toward spicy foods. Hard to believe . . . ? Try them!
